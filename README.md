## About

UtiliMate is a comprehensive Java utility library designed to simplify and accelerate the development process.
Inspired by the ease of use of _Pythonâ€™s built-in functions_, it provides a wide array of **static**
methods that handle common programming tasks.

The library provides functions for collection, list and map processing, as well as numerical operations,
reducing the need for repetitive boilerplate code, enhancing productivity and code readability.

It is especially useful for developers who want to write clean, maintainable code without having to 
reinvent the wheel for everyday tasks. With its wide arrange of features and easy to use API, UtiliMate aims
